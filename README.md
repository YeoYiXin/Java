# Java
 Created a congestion management and crowd control system.
 <br/><br/>
 The main program is display.java . Congestion Management and Crowd Control System is implemented to tackle or control congestion and crowded situations in hospital areas such as the waiting areas for visitors to visit the in-patient wards, outpatient clinics, and Intensive Care Units(ICU) leading toward the outpatient consultation rooms and the like within a hospital building.
<br/> <br/>
I have implemented this program with external inheritance, constructors, classes, objects, instance variables, loops, control statements, Random Number Generation (RNG) and polymorphism. Details regarding this program can be read in Report.pdf and Sample.pdf to observe generated output using various inputs.
